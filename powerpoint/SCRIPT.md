# VenueLink Pitch Script

**Total Duration:** ~2 minutes
**Pace:** ~20 seconds per slide (6 slides total)

---

## Slide 1: Title/Intro
**[18 seconds]**

> Hi, I'm Michael, and this is VenueLink. We're building a marketplace that connects student organizations with local venues for event bookings. We're making it fast and easy for student groups to find and book bars, restaurants, and event spaces.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**[22 seconds]**

> We know this problem intimately because we've lived it. As fraternity brothers, we've spent countless hours calling bar after bar trying to find one with availability for our events. Student organizations waste time on email and phone tag with no centralized way to compare venues or check availability. Meanwhile, venues struggle with disorganized communication, no formal booking process, and difficulty reaching student groups. There's no platform connecting these two sides.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution
**[20 seconds]**

> VenueLink is a centralized marketplace that solves this problem. Student organizations can browse all available venues in one place, filter by their needs like capacity and price, submit booking requests with their event details, and once a venue accepts, pay a booking fee to confirm. It's like Airbnb but designed specifically for student organizations and local venues. We've already built a working authentication system and student dashboard that you can see here.

---

## Slide 4: Current Progress
**[22 seconds]**

> Here's what we've built so far. We have a fully functional authentication system that verifies .edu emails, a working student organization dashboard, a complete backend API for venue management, and our database schema. We're using modern technologies like React, TypeScript, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL with an AI-powered development workflow. What's left to build includes the venue discovery page, the full booking request flow, and the venue admin dashboard. For validation, we've prepared comprehensive surveys and are planning to interview over 10 bars and 10 student organizations at Ohio State to validate our assumptions before full launch.

---

## Slide 5: Why We're Building This
**[20 seconds]**

> Why are we building this? Because we've lived it. We're fraternity brothers at Ohio State, and we've personally experienced the pain of spending hours calling bar after bar trying to find one with availability for our events. We understand this problem intimately because we ARE the customer. We have a unique perspective as both the people experiencing the pain and the technical skills to solve it. The market opportunity is significant - there are hundreds of student organizations at every major university, each booking multiple events per semester. Venues want this consistent business from student groups, but there's no centralized platform connecting them. That's what we're building.

---

## Slide 6: Conclusion
**[18 seconds]**

> We're Michael Gorman and Larry Stelzer, and we're building VenueLink. Our immediate next steps are to finish the core booking flow in the next two weeks, conduct validation interviews with student organizations and venues, onboard our first partners, and launch a beta at Ohio State within three months. We're looking for early venue partners who want to reach more student organizations and student org leaders who want to help shape this platform. If you're interested in learning more or getting involved, let's connect.

## Backup Script (Condensed - If Running Over Time)

If you're consistently running over 2 minutes, use these condensed versions:

### Slide 2 (Condensed):
> As fraternity brothers, we've lived this problem - hours calling bars to find availability. Student organizations have no centralized platform to compare venues. Venues have no formal system to reach student groups. Both sides are struggling.

### Slide 4 (Condensed):
> We've built a functional authentication system, student dashboard, backend API, and database using React, TypeScript, and FastAPI. What's left is the venue discovery page, booking flow, and admin dashboard. We're preparing to validate with surveys and interviews at Ohio State.

### Slide 5 (Condensed):
> We're building this because we've lived it as fraternity brothers. We ARE the customer - we understand the pain and have the technical skills to solve it. Hundreds of student orgs book multiple events per semester, but no platform connects them with venues.
