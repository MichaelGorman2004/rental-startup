### What's NOT Included (Per Your Request)

## 📸 Next Steps: Add Screenshots

To complete the presentation, you need 2-3 screenshots:

### Option 1: Use UI Mockups (Easiest)
1. Open `docs/ui-mockup.html` in browser
2. Take screenshots of:
   - Student Org Dashboard mockup
   - (Optional) Login page mockup
3. See `SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions

### Option 2: Use Actual Built Dashboard
1. Run frontend dev server
2. Navigate to dashboard (VL-006)
3. Take screenshot
4. More authentic, shows actual progress

### Where to Add Screenshots
- **Slide 3** has 2 placeholder boxes:
  - "[Login Page Screenshot]"
  - "[Student Org Dashboard Screenshot]"
- Simply replace these placeholders with your actual screenshots
